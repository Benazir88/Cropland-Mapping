# Cropland-Mapping
This study demonstrates how to fit harmonic regression and retrieve the coefficients to extract features from time series. Following that, croplands would be classified by random forest, and "ground truth" labels would be obtained from the ESA World Covers 2021.Cropland is being mapped using satellite data on a global scale, but mapping it locally still remains a challenge.
